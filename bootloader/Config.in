          Don't reset the bootloader transaction marker
          following a successful programming.  It is up to the
          bootloader to clear this environment variable on reboot.

          This option is useful for devices that implement a
          double-copy strategy, and can signal to the bootloader that
          a successful programming has occurred and that the bootloader
          should switch to the alternate partition.
